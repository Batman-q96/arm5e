Note that</p><p><strong>Game metadata:</strong> Since the description cannot be made available for copyright reasons, most Item types available in the system Compendium are provided with the name of the sourcebook they are coming from and the page they can be found (English edition). Their display is managed by a setting (see @UUID[Compendium.arm5e.journals.pD94JyolG7TBTwis.JournalEntryPage.pbpZGXKxANcTpr8R#settings]{Settings} )</p><p>A some of Item's types don't make sense for some Actor types (eg:Ability on a Covenant), they will be filtered and ignored.</p><h2>Abilities</h2><p>Beside the name, speciality and description, the following fields are available. A * indicates this field is only visible when it is owned.</p><p><br /><strong>Name: </strong>A note of the name: it can be whatever you want, in the language you want. The system doesn't care about it. (see Ability key below).</p><p><strong>Score</strong>: it can either be adjusted using the plus and minus signs or by directly inputting the experience amount.</p><p><strong>Default characteristic:</strong> This selects the characteristic used by default when you roll that ability</p><p><strong>Ability key:</strong> This is an <strong>important</strong> information for the system. It allows it to know which ability it is independently of its name. This permits the system to do a lot of things:</p><ul><li><p>Check if a character has a specific ability and its score</p></li><li><p>Automatically use an ability's score to implement some rules or compute some value (eg: Parma Magica, penetration).</p></li><li><p>Know which ability to progress during a long term activity</p></li><li><p>And more as the system evolves</p></li></ul><p><strong>In short, if you don't configure it properly, some features won't work.</strong><br /></p><p><strong>Ability option:</strong> This field is greyed out most of the time, except for generic abilities. See below</p><p><strong>Active effects on abilities</strong></p><p>Abilities modified by an active effect have a coloured halo</p><div class=\"grid-2col\"><div><img src=\"systems/arm5e/assets/userguide/EffectsOnAbilities.png\" /></div><div><p></p><p>Puissant ability</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Affinity with ability</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Affinity with ability and puissant ability</p><p><br /></p></div></div><h3>Generic abilities</h3><ul><li><p>Area lore, Organization lore, Languages (Dead or not), Craft, Profession, Mystery cult lore and supernatural power are generic abilities. They require an additional parameter to be recognized by the system, because there could be any number of them. Otherwise, it wouldn't be possible to differentiate them.</p></li><li><p>Each generic ability with a different Ability option is totally independent of the others. It has its own speciality an default characteristic on rolls.</p></li><li><p>Generic abilities in Compendia should already have their option set (eg: Dead language (Latin) has \"Latin\" in its ability option).</p></li><li><p>The ability option is particularly useful when you want to add an affinity or puissant ability virtue. If you have multiple instance of an ability (eg: leatherwork and glassblowing, both craft abilities), using the option will allow to pick the correct one.</p></li><li><p><strong>Important</strong>: only alphanumeric characters are allowed for an ability option. The system will automatically remove other characters. Use CamelCase if you want to put multiple words.</p><p></p></li></ul><h2>Virtues and Flaws</h2><p></p><p><strong>Type</strong>: Some Actors will only accept virtues and flaws of a certain type.</p><p><strong>Impact</strong>: only used to keep track of how many points are used at character creation.</p><h3>Effects:</h3><p>Virtues and flaws can have active effects which will be transmitted to their owner (see @UUID[Compendium.arm5e.journals.pD94JyolG7TBTwis.JournalEntryPage.Gm3bQXMrk6WUTBaJ]{Active effects}). Whenever possible, those are already configured in the system Compendia (eg: the Large virtue will give +1 size).</p><p><strong>Important: </strong>Due to a Foundry core's limitation, it is not possible to edit active effects of an owned Item. You must edit it first in the sidebar. It is particularly relevant for effects that need configuration like Affinity, Puissant art, etc.</p><p></p><h2>Base effects</h2><p>The base effect is the root of any magical effect, spell or powers. They are intended to be used in the @UUID[.X4B31bvwKOCJefPn#codex-hermeticum-(violet)]{Codex Hermeticum}.</p><p><strong>Requisites</strong>:</p><p>You can select additional arts as requisites by clicking on the hammer icon:</p><img src=\"systems/arm5e/assets/userguide/Requisites.png\" /><p>The <strong>base level</strong> is the level of a spell with this effect with minimal attributes (Range: self, Duration: Momentary, Target : individual). It is the same number found in the book for the spell guidelines.</p><h2>Magical effects</h2><p>A magical effect is like a spell and is designed like it. <br />The concept doesn't exist in the official rules, but it is used in the system to keep a collection of commonly used spontaneous effects for a character. Instead of designing it every time in play, it is ready to use.</p><p>See <strong>Spells</strong> below for more details about the fields</p><h2>Spells</h2><p><strong>Level: </strong>The level field is read only. It is computed from the base level and all the other attributes as per the rules.</p><p><strong>Spells attributes (Range, Duration, Target): </strong>By default, the list of available attributes is limited to those of the core book. However, using the <strong>sourcebook filter</strong> setting, you can expand the list to those present in other books (note that most of them have restriction for their use). The number in parenthesis is the amount of magnitudes the spell level will increase.</p><p><strong>Apply magical focus (owned): </strong>This is to indicate if the spell effect falls into the scope of any magical focus the character possesses. Casting total will be computed accordingly.</p><p><strong>Bonus and bonus description (owned): </strong>These fields are here to cover any specific bonus not covered by the system (yet). Examples: specialities of abilities like Artes liberales for rituals, Talisman bonuses,…</p><p><strong>Mastery (owned): </strong>Like abilities, you can change the score by using the plus and minus signs or directly put the total experience.</p><p><strong>Mastery abilities (owned)</strong>: Just a free form text field for now, but expect it to change in the future…</p><p><strong>General: </strong>If checked, it will display the field named <strong>Level Adjustment</strong></p><p><strong>Level Adjustment: </strong>this field allows to slightly adjust the level of a general spell so it is possible to have a value which is not a multiple of 5.</p><p></p><h2>Powers</h2><p><strong>Form</strong>: used for magic resistance</p><p><strong>Cost</strong>: used to compute penetration based on the owner might score.</p><h2>Enchantments</h2><p>Enchantments can be created from a magical effect or a spell using the @UUID[Compendium.arm5e.journals.pD94JyolG7TBTwis.JournalEntryPage.X4B31bvwKOCJefPn#codex-hermeticum-(violet)]{Codex Hermeticum}.<br />There is an additional tab with new attributes specific to enchanting.</p><p><br /><strong>Dev notes</strong>: Enchanting as an activity is not yet implemented in the system, but the sheet can still be used for design as the level is still computed automatically.</p><h2>Diary entry</h2><p>This item can be used as a standard diary for the character but also to create @UUID[Compendium.arm5e.journals.pD94JyolG7TBTwis.JournalEntryPage.x3UWNVGwHqQSh3sF]{long term activities} during down time between game sessions.</p><p><strong>Dev notes</strong>: the standard diary is still there for legacy reasons for people who used it as such in the past. I would recommend using a Foundry core JournalEntry for regular diaries as it is much easier to share between players or to do collaborative editing.</p><p></p><h2>Books</h2><p>Topic: You can select whether the book is about an Art, an abilities or a spell mastery</p><img src=\"systems/arm5e/assets/userguide/book_icons.png\" /><ul><li><p>Next to the topic field, there is a eye icon. It will open a @UUID[Compendium.arm5e.journals.pD94JyolG7TBTwis.JournalEntryPage.xpdDPJUjChabvRof#scriptorium]{Scriptorium} with all the book field preset.

That way you can name it as you wish and in the language you prefer. The option field is read-only most of the time, but it is used for generic abilities (eg: Area Lore, Crafting , Languages,... ) to distinguish them. For example, a character may know leatherwork and forging, both crafting abilities, the option field will allow to differentiate between the two.</p><div><p>This is useful when you need to tell the system which ability you are talking about.
