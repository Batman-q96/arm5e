There are different types of **Actors** that can be created:

Their sheets have been color coded for convenience, as well, so you can tell at a glance what they are.

- [[Player Characters]]: the PCs, belonging to the players, which are coded in blue;
- NPCs: the Non-Player Characters, that is, everybody else, basically, which are coded in brown. The fields in their sheets are pretty much like the Player Character's;
- [[Laboratories]]: for a magus to work, they need a laboratory, of course. These are coded in green;
- [[Covenants:]] the "extra character" of the saga, where the PCs and many NPCs live, coded in red;
- [[Magic Codex:]] a place where you can find a lot of information, such as base levels for spells, shape and material bonuses, for instance, as well as somewhere to experiment with creating effects, coded in violet;
- Beast: a beast, whether magical or mundane, coded in brown. Their sheets are very similar to a Player Character's one, for now.

If you're still following, we recommend you check [[Player Characters]] next.
